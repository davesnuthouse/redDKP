1.1.69 Changelog
-------------------------------------------------------------

Added features:
* (Done) Master switch to turn SYNC off on Editors page
* (Done) Option for the Editors tab that shows how many known addon users. Also fixed that the addon wasn't storing data for addon users properly.
* (Done) Option on the RL tools tab that selects raid members
* (Done) Edit button for DKP tab editors
* (Done) Mangs changes - (tweaks to names of dkp table columns and "new week" button)
* (Done) Redo RL Tools functionality to make it as lightweight as possible
* (Done) Toggle for Inviter to also show online guildies who aren't on dkp table

Bugs Squashed:

* (Fixed) DKP table headers cutoff?  (Rotation)
* (Fixed) When not in group you are not missing in inviter, and ML scorecard shows blank
* Editors moving to alts will allow their DKP table to be overridden by other editors because they now fall into the autosync rule.  Workaround is they do not use addon on alts.

Showstopper Bugs Squashed:
* (Fixed) The "Show hidden records" and "Show current raid members" options on DKP tab has the old bug where it hides table rows at the end of the list.  Ultimately the DKP table has a redraw logic issue that prevents the table refreshing correctly, likely due to duplication of process or incorrect recycling of assets.  Thankfully it doesn't impact the data at all it's just a view issue that seems to get worse when you use more filters/sorting.
* (Fixed) Lock/Unlock funtionality has made names field unable to be edited


PRE RELEASE ARCHIVE
------------------------------------------------------

Missing functionality I want to add/chage ASAP:
1. (Done) Cap on weekly ontime, attendance
2. A prettier way to handle the tell/whisper option?

4. (Done) Ability for folks to whisper an editor with "what's my DKP?" and get a whisper reply
5. (Done) Convert Minimap button to use Lib so it can hook into minimap addons (sexymap) better
6. (Done) Restore the missing "has rotated" data from the DKP table"
7. (Done) Restore the colours on the dkp table values that showed increases and decreases

16. (Done) Retains the tickboxes on group builder (to prevent loss on a DC), due to this will also have to add a clear (and heck whynot a tick all) option.
17. (Done) Remove funcitonality to check officers... it's not really needed as the addon uses it's own editors lists to determine who shouldnt sync and where data comes from.

Known Bugs:
1. (Fixed but blurry as all hell) Addon icon not displaying on the addons list
2. (Fixed) Top row record can show above the window when editing + scrolling
3. (Fixed) Audit log is back to showing lots of "unknowns" (display issue the data is there)
4. (Fixed) Minimap button being a twat (needs a full rebuild and Lib file)
5. (Fixed) Clicking away from edit value on DKP table doesnt deslect value (like pressing enter would)
6. (Fixed) On first load the dkp table displays blank, it takes a /reload for the data to display
7. (Fixed) It has lost formatting on the editors list due to fixing name sync issues (likely cosmetic)
8. (Fixed) After fixing 5 the window can nolonger be moved on the DKP tab
9. (Fixed) The group invites spams the user untill they accept the invite rather than once 
10. (Fixed) Personally it feels like there's a loop somewhere in the Editors code that makes it constantly check Editors, which is pointless... needs improved.
11. (Fixed) It can behave very erratically when GL/Editor is AFK or DND.  I know WHY that is but code might be able to be improved to do something else in this situation instead of fail (ie get data from another user?)
12. (Fixed) Broadcast DKP to raid is Alphabetical (Z first) reverse.
13. (Fixed - TLDR wasnt true) No editors online functionality needs imroving, most specifically the red warnings but just more ways for it to sync itself without waiting for manual.  It is possible that this is only true because of the editor sync issue.  Currently it looks like the warnings don't refresh but the addon knows an editor as come online (manual sync works).  So there's a mismatch there that needs looked into.
14. (Fixed) Notes on ML whiteboard don't work and the AI made it worse.
15. (Technically fixed as no longer exists) If previous editor gets rid of addon they get whisper spam from addon users.
16. (Fixed) On DKP whisper reply the Balance is 0
17. (Fixed) Table not refreshing after Add
18. Add button also needs clicked twice (once for defocus and once to activate)
19. (Fixed) Delete functionality causes display issue on dkp table (data is fine)
20. (Fixed?) ML tools table needs to be 'reset' to show changes to dkp table
21. DKP table headers cutoff?  (Rotation)
22. (Fixed) Not a bug but need to change feral dps to a new icon as it's the same as feral tank
23. (Fixed) Missing from group goes off the window on Inviter
24. (Fixed) Broadcast DKP broken
25. (Fixed) The column sizes on ML Scorecard aren't quite right on MS/OS so they highlight in a way that gives me autistic tingles.
26. (Fixed) Raid leader detection wasn't working (only assistant)
27. Force sync to Lunatic did not show her accept in summary
28. Double check summary info on inviter is counting tanks properly
29. When not in group you are not missing in inviter, and ML scorecard shows blank
30. The "Show hidden records" option on DKP tab has the old delete bug where it hides table rows at the end of the list.  Ultimately the DKP table has a redraw logic issue that prevents the table refresh, likely due to duplication of process or incorrect recycling of assets.  Thankfully it doesn't impact the data at all it's just a view issue that seems to get worse when you use more filters/sorting.
7. (Done) ML whiteboard
8. (Abandoned) Filter option for the dkp table
9. Guild crafting info?
10. Options screen to control variables that are currently hard coded
